IBM Bluemix Mobile Services - Client SDK Swift Security - Google
===================================================

This is the Google security component of the Swift SDK for IBM Bluemix Mobile Services.

https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/mobilefirst

## Requirements
* iOS 8.0 or later
* Xcode 7


## Installation
The Bluemix Mobile Services Google authentication Swift SDK is available via [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/).
To install, add the `BMSGoogleAuthentication` pod to your Podfile.

##### iOS
```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    platform :ios, '8.0'
    pod 'BMSGoogleAuthentication'
end
```

After you update your Podfile, the pod's sources are added to your workspace. Copy the `GoogleAuthenticationManager.swift` file from the `BMSGoogleAuthentication` pod's source folder to your app folder.

Then you need to create a bridging header and add the following line to it:
```Swift
#import <Google/SignIn.h>
```
After doing so add your "REVERSED_CLIENT_ID" (located in the `.plist` file you get from the Google developer console) and your "Bundle Identifier" as URL Types in your project.

## Getting started

In order to use the Bluemix Mobile Services Google Authentication Swift SDK, add the following imports in the class which you want to use it in:
```
import BMSCore
import BMSSecurity
import FBSDKLoginKit
```
<!--- EK: Is FBSDKLoginKit necessary for Google authentication? --->

Connectivity and interaction between your mobile app and the Bluemix services depends on the application ID and application route that are associated with Bluemix application.

The BMSClient API is the entry point for interacting with the SDK. You must invoke the following API before any other API calls:

```
initializeWithBluemixAppRoute(bluemixAppRoute: String?, bluemixAppGUID: String?, bluemixRegion: String)
```

The BMSClient API provides information about the current SDK level and access to service SDKs. This method is usually in the application delegate of your mobile app.

An example of initializing the MobileFirst Platform for iOS SDK follows:
<!--- EK: Should this be "Bluemix Mobile Services SDK"? No mention of MobileFirst until here, so it's confusing. --->

Initialize SDK with IBM Bluemix application route, ID and the region where your Bluemix application is hosted.
```Swift
BMSClient.sharedInstance.initializeWithBluemixAppRoute(<app route>, bluemixAppGUID: <app guid>, bluemixRegion: BMSClient.<region>)
```

Then you have to register Google as your authentication manager Authentication Delegate to the MCAAuthorizationManager as follows:
```Swift
GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.register()
```

The following code sends the openurl requests to the Google Authentication Manager and needs to be added to your AppDelegate.swift file:
```Swift
  func application(application: UIApplication,
        openURL url: NSURL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject) -> Bool {
            return GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.handleApplicationOpenUrl(openURL: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)
    }


    @available(iOS 9.0, *)
    func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [String : AnyObject]) -> Bool {
        return GoogleAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.handleApplicationOpenUrl(openURL: url, options: options)
    }
```
